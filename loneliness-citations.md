## Additional Notes

1. Many of these statistics are widely cited across multiple sources, with the original research sometimes conducted years before becoming widely recognized.

2. The comparison of loneliness to smoking 15 cigarettes per day has become a powerful public health message, though it represents an approximation based on comparing effect sizes across different mortality risk factors.

3. Recent research continues to support these findings, with studies during COVID-19 pandemic further highlighting the health impacts of social isolation.

4. When citing these sources, it's important to note that some findings represent meta-analyses combining multiple studies, while others are from individual large-scale studies.

5. The field continues to evolve, with newer studies sometimes showing slightly different percentages but consistently demonstrating significant health impacts of loneliness and social isolation.
